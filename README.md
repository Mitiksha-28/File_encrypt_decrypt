# File Encryption and Decryption System

This project is developed as part of the **Programming Paradigms CA-3** assignment. It demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a file encryption and decryption system in C++.

## Project Description

This system allows users to:
- Encrypt a text file using different encryption algorithms (XOR, Caesar cipher).
- Decrypt a previously encrypted file.
- Perform file handling operations like reading from and writing to files.
- Authenticate users to secure the encryption and decryption process.

The project demonstrates key OOP concepts like:
- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- File Handling

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example:
    ```bash
    g++ -o encryption.cpp -o encryption_program
    ```
3. Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./encryption_program
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to perform encryption or decryption on a file.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (g++, clang, etc.)
- Basic understanding of file handling and encryption algorithms.
